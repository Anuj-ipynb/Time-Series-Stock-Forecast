# Model Evaluation

## Metrics:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**

## How to Evaluate:
- Split data into train/test sets (e.g., last 12 months as test).
- Compare predicted vs actuals for ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.
- Visualize with line plots or bar charts.
